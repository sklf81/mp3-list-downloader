# mp3 list downloader
 This is a really useful python program, that can download mp3-files into a given directory.

## Why is it so useful?
 The best part about this is, that you just need to enter a list of song names and press enter.
 You don't need to enter the exact song name just some keyword.
 Also, you can download an entire list of songs just with a few clicks.
 
 Just imagine you are about to go on a road-trip and you want to download a bunch of songs to enjoy the ride, but you don't want to manually download every song at a time.
Exactly for pruposes like this you can use the list downloader script - it will make your life a lot easier.
 
## How does it work?
The script uses the youtube search-query to search for the song in the given list and then downloads the song with the correct audio codec.
Unfortunately the code isn't well documentet at the time, but hopefully in the future this thing will be a lot cleaner.

### Examples
```
               name on Youtube                                     text in the list downloader   
               
 "A Flock Of Seagulls - I Ran (So Far Away) (Video)"   -->   "a flock of seagulls i ran"
 "America - A Horse With No Name+Lyrics"               -->   "a horse with no name america"
 "Black Sabbath  War Pigs"                             -->   "black sabbath war pigs"
 "The Clash - Rock the Casbah (Official Video)"        -->   "rock the casbah"
 ```
