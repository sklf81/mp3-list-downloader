# mp3 list downloader
 This is a really useful python program, that can download mp3-files into a given directory.

## Why is it so useful?
 The best part about this is, that you just need to enter a list of song names and press enter.
 You don't need to enter the exact song name just some keyword.
 Also, you can download an entire list of songs just with a few clicks.
 
## How does it work?

####               name on Youtube                                     text in the list downloader   
               
 "A Flock Of Seagulls - I Ran (So Far Away) (Video)"   -->   "a flock of seagulls i ran"
